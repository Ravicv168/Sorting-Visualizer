This Sorting Visualizer project demonstrates various sorting algorithms through an interactive visualization. The user can see how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing how elements are swapped and moved during the sorting process.

The project features the following sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort

The algorithms are implemented with optimal time and space complexities to help understand their efficiency. The visualizer allows users to control the speed of the algorithm execution and visualize how elements change positions at each step
